// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='doing-procedure-a']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id='select-specific_JDK_procedure_perapplication{context}']
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Selecting specific JDK out of the installed versions per application
// Start the title of a procedure module with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

This procedure describes how to select the specific JDK per application out of the installed ones on {msw}

.Prerequisites

* More than one JDK is already installed on the system.

.Procedure

. Open the command prompt( Run as administrator) and set the prompt to C:/

. Type dir /b /s java.exe. This will list all the installed JDK on the system

. Set the value of the environment variable to your JDK (or JRE) installation path as follows:
   setx -m JAVA_HOME "Path to Java"
  If the path contains spaces, use the shortened path name.

. Restart Command Prompt to reload the environment variables 

. Use the following command to see the value.
