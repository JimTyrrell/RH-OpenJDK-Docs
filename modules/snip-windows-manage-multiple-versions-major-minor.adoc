[NOTE]
====
To manage different major and minor JDK versions two things must be done.

. Ensure that each major and minor JDK version is installed into its own unique directory.
. Ensure that your PATH and JAVA_HOME and any other environment variables point to the same version.
+
If different versions are used odd errors can occur.
